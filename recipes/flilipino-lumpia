    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ground pork (or chicken), grated carrot, chopped onion, minced garlic, beaten egg, soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), salt, black pepper, and sugar.
            Mix well until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Lay a lumpia wrapper on a clean surface.
            Place about 1 tablespoon of the filling in a thin line near one edge of the wrapper.
            Roll the wrapper tightly over the filling, folding in the sides as you roll.
            Seal the edge with the cornstarch-water mixture.
            </li>
        <li>If using large wrappers, cut each lumpia roll into 2-3 smaller pieces.
        </li>
        <li>RHeat oil in a deep pan over medium heat.
            Fry the lumpia in batches, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy (about 3-5 minutes).
            Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the lumpia hot with sweet and sour dipping sauce or banana ketchup.
