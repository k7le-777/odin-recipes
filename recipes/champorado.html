    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Champorado is a traditional Filipino rice porridge made with glutinous rice and cocoa, giving it a rich, chocolatey flavor. It is sweetened with sugar and often served with a drizzle of condensed milk for added creaminess. The dish is typically enjoyed warm as a comforting breakfast or snack, sometimes paired with tuyo (dried salted fish) for a balance of sweet and salty flavors. Its origins trace back to the Spanish colonial period, inspired by Mexican champurrado but adapted with local ingredients. Champorado is a beloved dish that evokes nostalgia and warmth in Filipino households.</p>
