    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ginaatang Manok is a Filipino chicken dish cooked in coconut milk (gata), resulting in a rich and creamy flavor. It often includes ingredients like ginger, garlic, onions, and chili for added depth and spice. Some variations include vegetables like papaya, chili leaves, or malunggay for extra nutrition.
