# Odin Recipes

This project is part of the **Odin Project** curriculum. In this project, I will be creating a recipe website where I will demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS. The focus will be on organizing recipes into categories, displaying images, and creating a user-friendly interface. 

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Basic HTML structure
- Linking between pages
- Using images on a website
- Creating simple styles with CSS

By the end of this project, I will have built a basic static website with recipes, showcasing my progress in front-end web development.
